## Monochrome - an minimal theme for IntelliJ editors

_Because syntax highlighting looks ugly_

This theme aims to make the editor have as few colors as possible while
still being usable. Syntax highlighting uses black, grey, and white, (except
for TODO comments).

It is created for my personal use. As such, there is no easy way to install this
yet. I highly encourage any fellow `:syntax off` people to fork/modify.

### Installing the colorscheme

You can install the colorscheme manually:

* Rename the `monochrome.xml` to `monochrome.icls`.
* In IntelliJ, go to Settings -> Editor -> Colorscheme.
* Click the gear icon -> Import Scheme -> IntelliJ IDEA color scheme.
* Select the `monochrome.icls` file.
