## Monochrome - a minimal theme for IntelliJ editors

This theme aims to make the editor have as few colors as possible while
still being usable. Syntax highlighting uses black, grey, and white, (except
for TODO comments).

It is created for my personal use, with choices that make sense to me. So your mileage may vary. I highly encourage any fellow `:syntax off` people to fork/modify.
